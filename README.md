Stream Vedio from Link in VLC Player
We can stream any video file download link in VLC player without downloading the whole file. But the process is a bit complicated. Many normal users not even aware of this feature.

For this reason, I have developed this small tool (for windows users). This application helps you to stream any video file link in VLC without downloading the file.

Download: LinkStream.VLC

How to Use: First copy a downloadable link of any video file and paste it into the Link Textbox. Then click Open in VLC button, that's it! VLC player will start streaming your video file.

N.B.:

VLC player need to be installed in your computer.

File name must be included in the link.

Enjoy ... ãƒ„
